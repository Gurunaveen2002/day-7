            <summary>CHICKEN65</summary>
            <P>Chicken 65 is a spicy, deep-fried chicken dish originating from Hotel Buhari,[1] Chennai,[2] India, as an entr√©e, or quick snack. The flavour of the dish can be attributed to red chillies, but the exact set of ingredients for the recipe can vary. It is prepared using boneless chicken and is usually served with an onion and lemon garnish. 
                Vegetarian variants like "Paneer 65" or "Gobi 65" use paneer or cauliflower instead

            <P>Chicken roasted in tandoor-like ovens is documented in the Harappan civilization of the Bronze Age of Indian subcontinent, as early as 3000 BC.[13][14][15][16][17][18] Much later, the Sushruta Samhita records meat being 
                cooked in an oven (kandu) after being seasoned with black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices
